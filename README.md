# WAD2_Movies
Sometimes, we just want to have an easy and quick fix to our movie itch. And when it comes to watching a movie with a group of friends, there can be a real hassle when deciding on one final outcome.  This project was meant to be let users search through a consolidated list across various streaming services and create shareable movie listings with custom template messages to various chats for family/friends.
